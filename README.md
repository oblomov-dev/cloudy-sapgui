# cloudy-sapgui

Classic SAP GUI transactions rebuilt as [abap2UI5](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5) apps.

Every screen keeps the layout of the SAP GUI window it replaces - menu bar,
system function bar with the command field, title bar, application function
bar, work area, status bar - but it is rendered as UI5 in the browser. No SAP
GUI installation, no Fiori launchpad, no OData service: the whole thing is
ABAP classes installed with abapGit.

The entry screen is `ZCL_SAPGUI_A2UI5`, a SAP Easy Access clone. It reads the
real area menu (structure `S000`, the same hierarchy the SAP GUI reads), shows
a Favorites folder, and accepts the usual command field syntax (`/nSE80`,
`/oSE80`, `SE80`).

## Transactions

| STMS            | Transport Management System   | `ZCL_STMS_A2U5`    |

The SAP menu tree lists the whole area menu, so it also shows transactions that
are not implemented here. Starting one of those gives a message instead of a
screen, and a transaction that does not exist at all is reported as such.

### What writes and what does not

Almost everything is display only. `ZCL_ZLK05_SYS_API`, which every screen uses
to read the system, has no method that changes system state.

Two exceptions:

- **SE80** (`ZCL_SE80_API`) is a real Workbench. It saves source with `INSERT
  REPORT`, activates objects, creates and deletes classes, interfaces and
  programs, and registers objects in transports.
- **SE16N** stores its display variants in `ZSE16N_A2U5_VAR`. It never changes
  the data of the table being displayed - the browser itself is read only.

Nothing here adds an authorization layer of its own. Users see and do exactly
what their own authorizations allow, the same as in the SAP GUI. Given what
SE80 can do, treat an installation like installing the Workbench itself.

## Requirements

- SAP_BASIS 7.50 or higher, standard ABAP. Not ABAP Cloud - the screens read
  system tables (`TADIR`, `TRDIR`, `SNAP`, `DD03L`, ...) and use classic
  Workbench APIs that are not released for the ABAP Cloud language version.
- [abap2UI5](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5), the UI5 runtime.
- [abap2UI5/ai-demokit](https://github.com/abap2UI5/ai-demokit), the views are
  built with `Z2UI5_CL_AI_XML` from that repository.

## Installation

Install the two dependencies first, then this repository, all with
[abapGit](https://abapgit.org):

```
https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5
https://github.com/abap2UI5/ai-demokit
https://github.com/oblomov-dev/cloudy-sapgui
```

Follow the [abap2UI5 quickstart](https://abap2ui5.github.io/docs/get_started/quickstart.html)
to set up the HTTP handler, then open it with the entry screen as the start
app - with the ICF path you gave the handler, for example:

```
/sap/bc/http/sap/z2ui5?app_start=ZCL_SAPGUI_A2UI5
```

From there the command field and the menu tree reach every screen listed above.

## Repository layout

```
src/
  zcl_sapgui_a2ui5.clas.abap     SAP Easy Access, the entry screen
  zcl_se*.clas.abap              one class per transaction
  zcl_sm*.clas.abap
  zcl_st*.clas.abap
  zcl_su01_a2u5.clas.abap
  zcl_scc4_a2u5.clas.abap
  zcl_rz11_a2u5.clas.abap
  zcl_stms_a2u5.clas.abap
  zcl_se80_api.clas.abap         SE80 repository API, the only writing class
  zcl_zlk05_sys_api.clas.abap    shared read only system API
  zcl_zlk05_gui_frame.clas.abap  the six bands of a SAP GUI window
  zcl_zlk05_client_dbl.clas.abap test double for z2ui5_if_client
  zse16n_a2u5_var.tabl.xml       SE16N display variants
```

The apps build views and dispatch events, they never read the system directly -
that is what `ZCL_ZLK05_SYS_API` and `ZCL_SE80_API` are for. The window frame
lives in `ZCL_ZLK05_GUI_FRAME`, so all screens look the same.

There are 292 ABAP Unit tests. They run against `ZCL_ZLK05_CLIENT_DBL` instead
of a live client, so the view and the event wiring can be asserted without a
browser.

## Development

The checks run on Node, no ABAP system needed:

```bash
npm ci
npm test        # abaplint.jsonc + abap_standard.jsonc
```

| Command                 | What it does                                        |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run lint`          | style and correctness profile (`abaplint.jsonc`)     |
| `npm run lint_standard` | syntax check against SAP_BASIS 7.50                  |
| `npm run lint_702`      | syntax check against SAP_BASIS 7.02                  |
| `npm run auto_fix`      | apply the quick fixes abaplint can apply on its own  |
| `npm run auto_downport` | rewrite `src/` to 7.02 syntax                        |

abaplint resolves the dependencies by cloning abap2UI5, the AI demo kit and the
Steampunk API intersect, so the first run needs network access.

CI, in `.github/workflows`:

| Workflow        | Trigger                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `abaplint`      | push to main, pull request    |
| `ABAP_STANDARD` | push to main, pull request    |
| `auto_fix`      | weekly, opens a pull request  |
| `auto_downport` | manual                        |
| `ABAP_702`      | push to 702, after a downport |

A few rules are switched off on purpose, with the reason written next to them
in `abaplint.jsonc`. This repository is a rebuild of the ABAP Workbench, so
`INSERT REPORT` and dynamic SQL are the feature rather than an accident, and a
table browser that selects from a table name known only at runtime cannot have
a static column list or `ORDER BY`.

## Downport

`npm run auto_downport` rewrites the sources to 7.02 syntax with abaplint, and
the `auto_downport` workflow pushes the result to a `702` branch that
`ABAP_702` then checks.

**The downport is not green yet**, which is why the workflow is manual and does
not run on every push - it must not force push a broken branch. What abaplint
cannot rewrite today:

- `SELECT` with a `LEFT OUTER JOIN`: the generated statement puts `INTO TABLE`
  before the `WHERE` clause, which does not parse. Nine selects in
  `ZCL_ZLK05_SYS_API` are affected.
- `COND` nested inside a `VALUE` constructor: the outer constructor is expanded
  but the inner `COND` is left as it is, mostly in `ZCL_SE16N_A2U5`.
- `DATA(x) = <call on a class abaplint cannot resolve>`: without the type the
  inline declaration cannot be split, mostly the `CL_OO_CLIF_SOURCE` calls in
  `ZCL_SE80_API`.

Making the sources downportable means hoisting those expressions and writing
the joins as separate selects. Until then `npm run lint_702` reports what is
left, and the sources stay on the 7.50 syntax the main branch is checked
against.
